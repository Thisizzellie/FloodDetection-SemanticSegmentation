Flood detection using semantic segmentation 



### Semantic segmentation is a computer vision technique where an AI model looks at an image and labels each pixel according to what object it belongs to.

we demonstrate the ability to create a flood detection segmentation model using satellite imagery. Using satellites to study flood is advantageous since physical access to flooded areas is limited and deploying instruments in potential flood zones can be dangerous. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing is much more efficient than manual or human-in-the-loop solutions.
